# ðŸŽµ Vibely â€“ Music Recommendation System

The project was carried out as part of a **undergraduate thesis** at the **UniversitÃ  Roma Tre**.

## ðŸ§  Objective of the project
Vibely is a web app aimed at creating personalized playlists based on the user's emotional state and tastes. 

I tried to go beyond traditional recommendation methods based on history and music genres by focusing specifically on the user's mood. 

Vibely uses a Gemini AI model by classifying the user's emotions through the Russell Circumplex Model. The mapping of the mood occurs directly and precisely with the use of valence and energy leading to a targeted musical choice.
